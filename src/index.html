Notes to Grader

- Progression: Early steps of the assignment are kept in separate commits to showcase incremental progress in building the scene.
- Collaboration: Worked with Sam Morrow. We frequently discussed the tutorials.
- Use of ChatGPT: 
  - Asked for clarifications on texture mapping and skybox implementation.
  - Utilized ChatGPT to refactor certain portions of code for readability. Also used for README.md.
  - Occasionally, auto-suggestions from GitHub Copilot introduced minor bugs, which were subsequently identified and resolved by manual debugging.
- Additional Features:
  - Implemented a custom statue model from internet resources.
  - Enhanced scene with shadows, fog, and label billboards for major objects.
- Performance:
  - Verified that the scene runs smoothly in Chrome and Firefox, maintaining an acceptable frame rate (approximately 30â€“60 FPS on a mid-range laptop).
- GUI & Interactions:
  - Used `lil-gui` to toggle visibility of various objects, lights, and controls.
  - OrbitControls allow for intuitive camera navigation around the scene. -->
